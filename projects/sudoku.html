                <h>Sudoku Solver</h>
                <p>
                    This piece of code solves a collection of sudoku puzzles (although it is capable of solving any solvable sudoku).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The algorithm is a simple backtracking algorithm. It places a number from 1 through 9 and tests if that number is valid within the current context of the board.
                    If it's valid, it moves onto the next location and does the same thing again. If it ever runs into an invalid state, it backtracks and tries a new set of numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that the algorithm is much faster than what is being displayed here. I slowed it down for visualization purposes. Most boards (unless specifically designed to slow this algorithm down) can be solved in under a second.
