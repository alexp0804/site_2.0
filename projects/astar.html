                <h>A* Pathfinder</h>
                <p>
                    I never formally learned A* in any of my classes, but it's 
                    very similar to something I did learn: breadth-first-search, a basic graph traversal algorithm.
                    The major difference between A* and BFS is that the A* <i>knows</i> where the end goal is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As it searches each cells neighbors, it prioritizes the neighbor that has the shortest distance to the goal.
                    This makes it much more efficient as it is informed about which cell is the best option to take.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This implementation allows you to pick the start and end node and draw any walls that act as obstructions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have fun messing about and seeing the algorithm work!
