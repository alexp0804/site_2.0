                <h>CHIP-8 Emulator</h>
                <p>
                    This was my first project that jumped into the world of emulation. Emulation is the process in which a system attempts to mimic another system as accurately as possible.
                    It's a very deep subject because there are <i>so </i>many factors that go into making a computer a computer: you have CPU timings, instruction cycles, flags, registers, memory maps, banks and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The CHIP-8 technically can't be emulated because it wasn't actual hardware. It was an interpreted language that ran through a virtual machine, so the correct term would be an interpreter.
                    However, the implementation is near enough to what an emulator does, so it often gets confused with or called an emulator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project was a lot of fun to work on. I read through many different resources that led to me truly understand and appreciate the inner workings of computer hardware at a deeper level than before.
                    The CHIP-8 is <i>absurdly </i>simple compared to modern computers, but that doesn't mean it isn't complicated. It handles input, sound, a couple different registers, and a few dozen op-codes, all of which you need to get the emulation working.
                </p>

                    This was also my first time using SDL for rendering, so it was a bit of a learning process to get it rendering the way I wanted it to. I'm sure there is ample room for improvement if I ever choose to use C + SDL for another project in the future!
